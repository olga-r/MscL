1) plumed_commitor_analysis.dat was used to calculate the committor value for a given snapshot. We started 100 runs for each snapshot and calculated the proportion of trajectories that reached the S1 state boundary first.
2) features_and_committors.dat contains information about all snapshots for which committors have been calculated. Each row corresponds to a snapshot. The last column contains the committor values. All columns except the last contain values of features that we used to optimize the reaction coordinates
3) fit_committors.py. This script takes a set of snapshots for which features and committor values are pre-computed, and uses Monte Carlo to search for the combination of features that maximizes the adjusted R2 value. The script outputs the selected features along with the optimized coefficients
